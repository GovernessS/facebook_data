## Facebook Data Challenge

This is a group project working with two other students to work on a Data Challenge at the Facebook HQ. Our group was a finalist in the competition. For the challenge, we needed to answer the following questions:

1. I am thinking about opening a business in San Francisco. The problem is, I'm not very familiar with San Francisco so I need help. I want someone to:

Help me understand the business landscape in San Francisco.

Help me figure out what type of business I should open and where.
  
2. How can this dataset be used to improve one of Facebook's products (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp)?
